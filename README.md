###General Info
-------------------------------------------
Black Diamond is a business in Roosevelt, UT and asked me to build them a website for their company when I didnt know Angualar or any coding. I used Wix.com to build them a templated website. Now that I know coding I revamped/recreated the same website in Angular with a MongoDB Backend for the data.
